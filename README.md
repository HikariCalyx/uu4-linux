# UU4 for Linux
Bootloader Unlock Utility 4 for Linux

## Supported OS
Any modern Linux distros should work, including Debian, Ubuntu, Deepin/UOS, Arch, Fedora, openSuSE Tumbleweed - even Crostini under Chrome OS works.
macOS and other BSD distros are untested.

We don't recommend you to run it under WSL.

## Missing Feature from UU4 for Windows
* Magisk Root Installation feature. If you're using Linux you should know how to install Magisk root yourself easily.
